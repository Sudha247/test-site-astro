  Choices I made while setting up this site.
---

I got this site up a couple of weeks ago. I had an old website gerenated with a static site generator too. It worked quite ok, but I wasn't particularly happy with the website, or how it looked. I've wanted to revive my personal site for a while, as an medium for sharing my thoughts. I'm not too big a fan of social media sites, for various reasons -- we'd need a separate post to cover that. I acquired this domain recently, for my sole propreitership company in the Netherlands. This gave me a newfound purpose to revive my personal website ande keep it more up to date. A static site generator seemed like an obvious choice. Well, there could be other frameworks out there but my main goal was to get something up and running quickly.

Now comes the question of which static site generator to pick, amongst the large number of options. I got some time in my hands at the [MirageOS retreat](https://retreat.mirage.io/) and did a small exploration on static site generators. I firstly wanted to try something in OCaml, with dogfooding in mind (dogfooding: use your own dogfood). There are a few static site generators built in OCaml and some of them work quite well IMO.
