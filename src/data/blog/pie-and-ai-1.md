  Experience at The Hague AI meetup.
---

On 27 November 2025, I attended a meetup at [The Hague University of Applied
Sciences](https://www.thuas.com/), titled [Pie and
AI](https://www.meetup.com/nl-NL/the-hague-ai/). I’ve biked past this place many
times, but this was the first time I went in, and I must say it was quite nice.

It was an interesting meetup, and my intention in writing this post is to record
what I learned there. The topic of the meetup this time around was
**Re-imagining Education in the Age of AI**. Now is perhaps a good time to
discuss this. The field of AI is not new — John McCarthy coined the term
*Artificial Intelligence* in the 1960s, and Turing came up with the Turing test
even earlier. But with the advent of Large Language Models, and the ever-growing
easy access to them, with companies rushing to release the “best” models first,
maybe the way we learn is changing. The meetup had three computer science
educators come together to discuss education in the age of AI.

The panel was moderated by [Fiona Passantino](https://www.fionapassantino.nl/).
Joining the panel were [Sonia de Jager](http://www.n-o.ooo/), a researcher
working on the philosophy of (natural) language modulation; [Felienne
Hermans](https://www.felienne.com/), Professor of Computer Science Education at
VU Amsterdam; and [Steffen
Steinert](https://www.tudelft.nl/staff/s.steinert/), Assistant Professor in the
Ethics and Philosophy of Technology at TU Delft. It was a good turnout, with more
than fifty people in the audience.

The host, Vikram Radhakrishnan, gave an introduction about the meetup — it has
been running since 2017 with a diverse set of topics each time by invited
speakers. This also gives the institute opportunities to nurture industrial
relationships. Following this, Fiona, the moderator, gave an introduction to the
day's discussion. Fiona is a trainer working in the field of AI education. She
made the argument that at one point the calculator was thought to be a device
that slowed down one's arithmetic abilities and was not allowed in exams — but
that is no longer the case, as calculators have become extremely common, even in
exams. The internet at one point was not widely accessible, and people believed
it might hinder learning because one could look up information easily.

She posed the question: are we at a similar juncture of skepticism with AI and
its effect on education and learning? She argued that industry has already begun
moving toward heavy use of AI, and perhaps students coming out of university are
not fully prepared, as they do not get the chance to develop these skills during
their education. She mentioned that the [EU AI
Act](https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai)
has mandated that employers are responsible for ensuring AI literacy among the
workforce — but what about students? She added that China has committed to
achieving 100% AI literacy among its citizens.


This was followed by introductory talks from the panelists. Dr. Felienne
Hermans started by describing how radical change has been a common theme across
history — from radio, TV, video, the internet, and MOOCs to now GenAI. The
argument that GenAI provides a personalised learning experience is also not new,
as [Teaching Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_machine) were
proposed as early as the 1920s.

Following this, Dr. Sonia de Jager began by posing a question: What and whom is
education for? She argued that you would want to provide reliable information to
students, and not all information produced by LLMs is necessarily fact-checked.
She concluded by posing another question: while GenAI will inevitably exist, what
about the commodification of learning, gatekeeping of learning, and scientific
integrity?

The last talk before the panel discussion, by Dr. Steffen Steinert, covered
Values and AI in Education. He began by highlighting general ethical issues with
AI — bias, massive energy use, intellectual property concerns, and the clickwork
needed to enable it. But the bigger question is whether AI aligns with
educational values: teacher autonomy, personal development, inclusion,
socialization, etc. He noted that the relevance of these values is changing and
that new values, such as efficiency, are emerging, possibly leading to value
conflicts.

There was a panel discussion next, with Fiona and later the audience posing
questions to the panelists. The first question was about their opinions on
students using AI. A fitting question to start with, given all of them are
educators in CS. They responded that while they don’t necessarily condone it,
they don’t actively encourage it either, and they provide a disclaimer to
students to use AI at their own discretion at the beginning of the course.
Dr. Hermans also highlighted that one cannot be a creator if they continue to be
only a consumer. A parallel was made between social media and LLMs — one thing
to note here is that there is scientific evidence showing social media’s harm,
whereas there aren’t many studies in that direction for LLMs yet. Overall, all
of the panelists were not very pro-AI and, in particular, did not have a very
charitable opinion about LLMs.


Casual conversations with attendees and speakers after the session were also
interesting. There was lots of thought-provoking discussion about how AI is
affecting how we learn and how we work. A fellow attendee shared that her
daughter, who is studying for an undergraduate degree, went through multiple “AI
interviews” for internships without actually talking to a human. Later, there
were conversations about the sustainability of large AI companies and how they
plan to use more energy and set up more and more data centres, and that too more
frequently. All this made me think about the topic not only from a learning
point of view but also from an environmental impact point of view. It remains to
be seen how LLMs evolve, with large tech companies rushing to release the best
models.


Overall I really enjoyed being there and look forward to attending the event
again.
