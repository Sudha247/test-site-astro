Hi! I'm Sudha, a software engineer from Chennai, India. I'm currently based in The Hague, Netherlands, living with my partner and our cat. I work at [Tarides](https://tarides.com/) on the OCaml ecosystem. Previously, I was a research engineer at IIT Madras on the [Multicore OCaml](https://github.com/ocaml-multicore) project. Prior to that, I developed backend systems at [Northern Arc Capital](https://www.northernarc.com/).
