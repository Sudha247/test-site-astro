- **Ecosystem Enhancement**: Contributed to improvements across the OCaml ecosystem, including the OCaml compiler, concurrency libraries (domainslib, Eio), platform tools, and community initiatives.  
- **Parallel Programming**: Co-developed and maintained domainslib, a task parallelism library for OCaml, implementing optimized parallel algorithms for array operations and parallel scan functionality.  
- **Effects based IO**: Contributed to the Eio library (algebraic effects-based direct-style I/O for OCaml) by designing and implementing benchmarking infrastructure with performance metrics, while serving as release manager for Eio 1.0 to ensure a smooth, well-coordinated deployment.  
- **Lockfree Data Structures**: Bootstrapped the Saturn library of concurrent data structures for OCaml 5, mentoring new contributors and conducting code reviews for complex implementations including lock-free hashmaps and skiplists.  
- **Team Leadership**: Founded and led the 'Multicore Applications' team from inception to 10 members, managing key client relationships with Jane Street and Nomadic Labs while supporting the Engineering Manager with project management responsibilities.  

**Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT Madras)**  
*Research Software Engineer*  
*Chennai, India*  
*Dec 2019 - June 2021*  

- **Upstreaming Multicore OCaml**: Core contributor to Multicore OCaml, focused on backporting and upstreaming Garbage Collector improvements, including Domain-local storage and mark stack optimization. Enhanced test coverage for underutilized compiler features such as Weak values, Ephemerons, and Finalizers.  
- **Parallel Programming**: Developed parallel benchmarks for evaluating various garbage collection schemes. Went on to author the first tutorial and documentation for parallel programming with Multicore OCaml.  

**Northern Arc Capital**  
*Technology Associate*  
*Chennai, India*  
*May 2019 - Dec 2019*
